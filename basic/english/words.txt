the next attribute we need
file mine will be named
style sheet is in charge of the overall appearance
file is in charge of the interactivity

I tend to put them right next to each other
do whatever's most convenient for you
generate the necessary setup
you can type exclamation point then hit tab
that's all we'll need for now
typically used as the home page
